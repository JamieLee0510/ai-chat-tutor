-   Could check the [demo website](https://ai-chat-tutor.vercel.app), but main features might fail due to running out of api budget.

## Run the project in local

-   create `.env` file, and also set environment variables according to `.env.example`
    -   `OEPNAI_API_KEY` could register on [openai api platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    -   `ELEVENLAB_KEY` could register on [elevenlabs profile](https://elevenlabs.io/api)
-   `$ npm install`
-   `$ npm run dev`
